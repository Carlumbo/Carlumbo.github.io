Im posting this blog post about the Rails APi and JS Wombo Combo that i just completed. It appears that I wasnt quite ready at the start of this portfolio project, but I've really got into the swing of it and found that I love working with CSS. 
I built some nice scrolling effects in my project and made it visually appealing (if it was 99'). I found it to be a nice mixture of thing. Here is some example of my css 
 ```
  .center2 {

    position: relative; 
    left: 800px;
    top: -300px; 
    color: #e25c1e;
    background-image: url("../img_folder/fabric.jpg");
    background-size: cover;
     width: 500px;
     text-align: center;
     border: 1px solid black;
    outline-style: solid;
    outline-color: #e4676f;
    background-attachment: fixed;   
    background-repeat:no-repeat;

}

.blue2 {
    background-color: #fbff00;
    color: #026999;
    border-color: #e4676f;
    text-align: center;
    font-size: 14px;
  }

.input-field {
    color: #e25c1e;
    font-size: 20px;
}

body {
    background-image: url("../img_folder/wood.jpg");
          background-repeat:no-repeat;
        background-size: 2024px 1024px;
        margin: 0px;
        background-attachment: fixed;
  } 

.fabric {
    background-image: url("../img_folder/fabric.jpg");

  background-attachment: fixed;
  color: #e25c1e;
  text-align: center;
    font-size: 14px; 
    border: 3px solid #e4676f;
    border-bottom-left-radius: 50% ;
    border-bottom-right-radius: 50% ;
    background-size: 1000 2100px ;
}

#blog-form {
    position: relative;
    top: 50px; 
    background-image: url("../img_folder/fabric.jpg");
    background-repeat:no-repeat;
    margin-right: 800px ;
    text-align: center;
    background-attachment: fixed;  
    color: #e25c1e;
    font-size: 14px; 
    border: 3px solid #e4676f;
    border-radius: 40% 40%;

}

.note-list {
    position:relative; left:-150px; 
    top:2px; 
}
```

I realize i could have used pre-built Stylesheets, but i wanted to take a crack at it myself instead. 

# Now the hard part:

JavaScript promises gave me some trouble thoughout. I would think i would be on track to the right thing, but i would only find out it wasn't quite working for some fo thigs I did, but i could get it to read the json and create new parts. What i really wanted in corporate in it was a delete function and i will be doing that in the future. I actaually had a good time creating this project for the most part. I think adding that delete note functionality is my next step and then incorporating all the views from last project just to make a fully functioning web application.
